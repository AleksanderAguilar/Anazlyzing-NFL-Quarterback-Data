# Analyzing Quarterback Data

This project was done in collaboration with Kyle Sacks, Narayan Sharma, Reece Calvin. The jupyter notebook contains the majority of the code used to clean and process the data as well as to run our machine learning models. It also contains some of the plots created to visualize some of our data. 

## Data 
Four our data we primaraly used a csv from https://github.com/fivethirtyeight/data/tree/master/nfl-elo as well as webscraping from www.pro-football-reference.com. The elo and other quarterback stats where collected for each quarterback for each season starting with the 1950 season.
